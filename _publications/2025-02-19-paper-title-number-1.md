excerpt: ' Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are recognized for their energy efficiency due to spike-based communication. In this
 regard, the shift towards SNNs is driven by their ability to significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining the
 performance of ANNs. Converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is a key research focus, but existing methods
 often struggle with balancing conversion accuracy and latency, and are typically restricted to ReLU activations. We introduce
 Precision Spiking (PS) neurons, a novel dynamic spiking neuron model that can precisely fit any activation function by jointly
 regulating spike timing, reset voltage, and membranepotentialthreshold.Thiscapabilityenables exactparameteroptimization
 via iterative methods, achieving low-latency, high-accuracy ANN-to-SNN conversion. Experiments on image classification
 and natural language processing benchmarks confirm state-of-the-art results, with a maximum conversion loss of 0.55% and
 up to 0.38% accuracy improvement over the original ANN. To the best of our knowledge, this method offers a significant
 advancement over existing approaches by achieving high-precision fitting of arbitrary activation functions with low latency
 and minimal conversion loss, thus considerably expanding the range of feasible ANN-to-SNN conversions.'
