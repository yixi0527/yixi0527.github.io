Hi, I'm **Wang Tianqi**, currently an **undergraduate student** in **Intelligent Science and Technology** at **Donghua University**. I'm passionate about the intersection of **Neural AI**, **Neuroscience**, and **AI for Science**, and I'm actively exploring how intelligent systems can deepen our understanding of the brain and accelerate scientific discovery.

## Research Interests

My academic interests lie in combining **artificial intelligence** with **neuroscience** and **computational modeling** to build interpretable, brain-inspired AI systems. I am particularly excited about:

- **Neural AI & Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**
- **AI-driven modeling of neural and cognitive processes**
- **AI for Science (AI4Science)**

My goal is to develop AI tools that not only perform efficiently but also provide insight into complex biological and cognitive systems—especially in understanding mental health and brain function.

## Publications

**[Precise Spiking Neurons for Fitting Any Activation Function in ANN-to-SNN Conversion](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-025-06354-z)**
*Applied Intelligence*, February 19, 2025

In this work, I proposed a novel spiking neuron model (PS neuron) to improve the fidelity of converting artificial neural networks (ANNs) into spiking neural networks (SNNs). This research offers a practical approach to bridging the gap between traditional ANNs and energy-efficient SNNs, while preserving function equivalence.

## Academic Background

Beyond my major, I actively pursue interdisciplinary learning—taking extra courses in **mathematics**, **biomedical sciences**, and **cognitive psychology**. I'm also part of a **university honors program** focused on industrial big data and intelligent systems, which has further shaped my interest in brain-inspired computing and intelligent healthcare.

## Looking for Opportunities

I am currently seeking **research internships**, **graduate study positions**, or **collaborations** in the fields of:

- Neural and brain-inspired computing
- Neuroscience-AI integration
- Scientific discovery with AI (AI4Science)

If you’re working in these areas or simply interested in a conversation, I’d love to connect!
