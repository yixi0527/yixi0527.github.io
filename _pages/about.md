# About Me

Hello! My name is **Wang Tianqi**, and I am an **undergraduate student** at **Donghua University** (2025.03). I am deeply passionate about the intersection of **Neural AI**, **Neuroscience**, and **AI for Science**.

## Research Interests

My academic journey is driven by my strong interest in exploring how **artificial intelligence** can contribute to scientific advancements. I am particularly focused on areas like:

- **Neural AI**
- **Neuroscience and AI integration**
- **AI4Science**

I aim to contribute to the field by advancing AI models and techniques that enhance our understanding of neuroscience and help solve complex scientific problems.

## Published Work

I am proud to share my published paper:

**Title**: [Precise spiking neurons for fitting any activation function in ANN-to-SNN Conversion](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-025-06354-z)
**Published on**: February 19, 2025, in *Applied Intelligence*

This paper showcases my research on precise spiking neurons and their role in converting artificial neural networks (ANNs) to spiking neural networks (SNNs), which is a crucial step in improving AI models.
